# Prisma Relations and Redwood's Generators

These docs apply to Redwood v0.25 and greater. Previous versions of Redwood had limitations when creating scaffolds for any one-to-many or many-to-many relationships. Most of those have been resolved so you should definitely [upgrade to 0.25](https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/upgrading-to-redwoodjs-v0-25-and-prisma-v2-16-db-upgrades-and-project-code-mods/1811) if at all possible!

## Many-to-many Relationships

[Here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations#many-to-many-relations)
are Prisma's docs for creating many-to-many relationships - A many-to-many
relationship is accomplished by creating a "join" or "lookup" table between two
other tables. For example, if a **Product** can have many **Tag**s, any given
**Tag** can also have many **Product**s that it is attached to. A database
diagram for this relationship could look like:

```
┌───────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐      ┌───────────┐
│  Product  │     │  ProductsOnTag  │      │    Tag    │
├───────────┤     ├─────────────────┤      ├───────────┤
│ id        │────<│ productId       │   ┌──│ id        │
│ title     │     │ tagId           │>──┘  │ name      │
│ desc      │     └─────────────────┘      └───────────┘
└───────────┘
```

The `schema.prisma` syntax to create this relationship looks like:

```javascript
model Product {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  desc     String
  tags     Tag[]
}

model Tag {
  id       Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name     String
  products Product[]
}
```

These relationships can be [implicit](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations) (as this diagram shows) or [explicit](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations#explicit-many-to-many-relations) (explained below). Redwood's SDL generator (which is also used by the scaffold generator) only supports an **explicit** many-to-many relationship when generating with the `--crud` flag. What's up with that?

## CRUD Requires an `@id`

CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) actions in Redwood currently require a single, unique field in order to retrieve, update or delete a record. This field must be denoted with Prisma's [`@id`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#id) attribute, marking it as the tables's primary key. This field is guaranteed to be unique and so can be used to find a specific record.

Prisma's implicit many-to-many relationships create a table _without_ a single field marked with the `@id` attribute. Instead, it uses a similar attribute: [`@@id`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#id-1) to define a *multi-field ID*. This multi-field ID will become the tables's primary key. The diagram above shows the result of letting Prisma create an implicit relationship.

Since there's no single `@id` field in implicit many-to-many relationships, you can't use the SDL generator with the `--crud` flag. Likewise, you can't use the scaffold generator, which uses the SDL generator (with `--crud`) behind the scenes.

## Supported Table Structure

To support both CRUD actions and to remain consistent with Prisma's many-to-many relationships, a combination of the `@id` and [`@@unique`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#unique-1) attributes can be used. With this, `@id` is used to create a primary key on the lookup-table; and `@@unique` is used to maintain the table's unique index, which was previously accomplished by the primary key created with `@@id`.

> Removing `@@unique` would let a specific **Product** reference a particular **Tag** more than a single time.

You can get this working by creating an explicit relationship—defining the table structure yourself:

```javascript
model Product {
  id       Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  desc     String
  tags     Tag[]
}

model Tag {
  id       Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  name     String
  products Product[]
}

model ProductsOnTags {
  id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  tagId     Int
  tags      Tag[]     @relation(fields: [tagId], references: [id])
  productId Int
  products  Product[] @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id])
  @@unique([tagId, productId])
}
```

Which creates a table structure like:

```
┌───────────┐      ┌──────────────────┐     ┌───────────┐
│  Product  │      │  ProductsOnTags  │     │    Tag    │
├───────────┤      ├──────────────────┤     ├───────────┤
│ id        │──┐   │ id               │  ┌──│ id        │
│ title     │  └──<│ productId        │  │  │ name      │
│ desc      │      │ tagId            │>─┘  └───────────┘
└───────────┘      └──────────────────┘

```

Almost identical! But now there's an `id` and the SDL/scaffold generators will work as expected. The explicit syntax gives you a couple additional benefits—you can customize the table name and even add more fields. Maybe you want to track which user tagged a product—add a `userId` column to `ProductsOnTags` and now you know.
